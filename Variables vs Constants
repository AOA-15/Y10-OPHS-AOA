#This is a comment
#Variables Vs Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1Name = "Chelsea"
Team2Name = "aresnal"

# Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variables can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Chelsea"
#This will cause a syntax eror

#Variables cannot have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Chelsea"
#This will be a syntax error 

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values is a CONSTANT do NOT change
